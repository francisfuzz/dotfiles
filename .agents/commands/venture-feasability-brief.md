# Venture Feasibility Brief

Use this before going into `/interview` mode. Fill it out cold, then share with Claude to validate feasibility.

## Constraints (Non-negotiable)
- **Timeline**: [days/weeks/months]
- **Time availability**: [hours per day/week]
- **Starting capital**: $[X] (or "none")
- **Location/jurisdiction**: [if relevant]
- **Commitment level**: [e.g., "willing to risk capital" vs "prefer low-risk validation"]

## Goal (Quantified)
- **Target return**: $[X]/[timeframe] or [metric]/[timeframe]
- **Validation criteria**: [What proof would convince you it works?]
- **Success threshold**: [What counts as "good enough to scale"?]

## What I Know
- [1-2 sentences on the problem or why this matters]

## What I Don't Know
- [Uncertainty 1]
- [Uncertainty 2]
- [Uncertainty 3]

## Math Check (Before Interview)
- Goal requires: [X outcome per unit time]
- I have: [Y time/capital available]
- Preliminary math says: [Realistic? Y/N]
- If no: [What would need to change?]

## What I Want From Interview Mode
- [e.g., "Validate if my math holds" or "Identify what's missing"]
- [e.g., "Give me 2-3 alternative paths if my main idea isn't viable"]
