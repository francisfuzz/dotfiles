# Engineering Project Brief

Use this before going into `/interview` mode. Fill it out cold, then share with Claude to validate feasibility.

## Constraints
- Timeline: X
- Team size: Y
- Technical debt tolerance: [high/medium/low]
- Maintenance burden: [acceptable/minimal]

## Goal
- Success metric: [e.g., "deploy and serve 1k users" vs "reduce latency by 30%"]
- Business impact: [What does this enable?]

## Technical Unknowns
- [Uncertainty 1]
- [Uncertainty 2]

## Risk Assessment
- Single point of failure: [what breaks this?]
- Scaling constraint: [what stops it from growing?]
```
