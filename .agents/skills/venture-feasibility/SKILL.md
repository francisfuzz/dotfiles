# Venture Feasibility Brief

Use this skill to reality-check business ideas before committing significant time or capital. Focus on constraints, timeline, and math.

## When to Use

- **New business idea** – Validate before building
- **Side project consideration** – Understand resource requirements
- **Opportunity evaluation** – Compare competing ideas with math
- **Investor pitch prep** – Pressure-test your assumptions
- **Go/no-go decision** – Clear decision criteria based on numbers

## The Brief

### Constraints (Non-negotiable)

Define what's fixed about your situation:

- **Timeline**: [days/weeks/months] – How long can you spend?
- **Time availability**: [hours per day/week] – What's realistic?
- **Starting capital**: $[X] (or "none") – What's the budget?
- **Location/jurisdiction**: [if relevant] – Where are you operating?
- **Commitment level**: [e.g., "willing to risk capital" vs "prefer low-risk validation"] – What's your risk tolerance?

### Goal (Quantified)

Be specific about success:

- **Target return**: $[X]/[timeframe] or [metric]/[timeframe] – What does winning look like?
- **Validation criteria**: [What proof would convince you it works?] – What's the MVP that proves it?
- **Success threshold**: [What counts as "good enough to scale"?] – When do you pull the trigger?

### What I Know

1-2 sentences on:
- The problem or why this matters
- Why you're uniquely positioned to solve it
- Why now (market timing)

### What I Don't Know

List key uncertainties:
- [Uncertainty 1 – e.g., "Market size is unclear"]
- [Uncertainty 2 – e.g., "Regulatory environment unknown"]
- [Uncertainty 3 – e.g., "Competitor response"]

### Math Check (Before Interview)

Do the basic math yourself:

- **Goal requires**: [X outcome per unit time] – e.g., "100 customers per month"
- **I have**: [Y time/capital available] – e.g., "10 hours/week, $5k budget"
- **Preliminary math says**: [Realistic? Y/N] – Does it add up?
- **If no**: [What would need to change?] – e.g., "Need 2x more time" or "Market too small"

### What I Want From Interview Mode

Be explicit about what you need validated:
- [e.g., "Validate if my math holds at this price point"]
- [e.g., "Identify what's missing from my model"]
- [e.g., "Give me 2-3 alternative paths if my main idea isn't viable"]

## Example: SaaS Product

```
Constraints:
- Timeline: 6 months
- Time availability: 20 hours/week
- Starting capital: $10k
- Location: US/EU
- Commitment: Willing to invest capital, not time off day job

Goal:
- Target return: $5k/month recurring revenue by month 6
- Validation criteria: 10 paying customers with recurring billing
- Success threshold: $2k/month MRR = proceed to funding/hire

What I Know:
- Problem: Developers waste 2-3 hours/day on manual log analysis
- Why me: 5 years in DevOps, built logging system at last company
- Why now: AI makes this doable; market ready after major cloud migration trend

What I Don't Know:
- Will developers pay for this? (vs free alternatives)
- How to acquire customers? (no existing network in this space)
- Competitive response from major cloud providers?

Math Check:
- Goal requires: ~2k ARR customer base (at $50/month avg)
- I have: 20 hrs/week * 26 weeks = 520 hours total
- Building: ~200 hours (MVP), Sales/support: 320 hours
- Preliminary: Tight but possible if MVPs works first try
- If no: Need more capital to hire contractor

What I Want:
- Is 20 hrs/week realistic or am I underestimating time?
- What should I charge? (validate $50/month assumption)
- Should I validate with early beta users first?
```

## How to Use

1. **Fill it out alone** – Work through the numbers yourself
2. **Reality check with Claude** – Paste the brief and ask: "Does this math check out? What am I missing?"
3. **Run interview mode** – If answers unclear, use the **interview** skill for Socratic questioning
4. **Make go/no-go decision** – Based on the brief + interview, decide whether to proceed
5. **Keep as reference** – Update as you learn more

## Decision Framework

After completing the brief:

### Go
- Math holds under reasonable assumptions
- Key uncertainties validated (or low risk)
- You have time/capital to attempt it
- Clear first milestone

### No-Go
- Math doesn't work unless something major changes
- Key assumption is invalid
- Too much capital/time for payoff
- Clear blocker you can't overcome

### Pivot
- Same problem, different approach
- Different market or distribution
- Different pricing or business model

## Next Steps

- **Math still unclear** → Use **interview** skill to pressure-test assumptions
- **Ready to build** → Use **engineering-brief** for technical planning
- **Need validation** → Design a cheap experiment to test riskiest assumption
- **Pitching to investors** → Use this brief as foundation for detailed deck

**Pro tip**: The math will almost always show your first idea is too expensive or too small. That's the point—find it now before you waste 6 months.
