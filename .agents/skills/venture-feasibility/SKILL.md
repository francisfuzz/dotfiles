# Venture Feasibility Brief

Reality-check business ideas before committing time or capital. Focus on constraints, timeline, and math.

## Gather the Brief

Walk the user through each section. Do not skip the math check.

### Constraints (Non-negotiable)
- **Timeline**: [days/weeks/months]
- **Time availability**: [hours per day/week]
- **Starting capital**: $[X] or "none"
- **Location/jurisdiction**: [if relevant]
- **Commitment level**: risk tolerance (e.g., "willing to risk capital" vs "low-risk validation")

### Goal (Quantified)
- **Target return**: $[X]/[timeframe]
- **Validation criteria**: what proof shows it works?
- **Success threshold**: what's "good enough to scale"?

### What I Know
1-2 sentences each: the problem, why uniquely positioned, why now.

### What I Don't Know
List 2-4 key uncertainties (market size, regulation, competitor response, etc.).

### Math Check
- **Goal requires**: [X outcome per unit time]
- **I have**: [Y time/capital available]
- **Preliminary math**: realistic? If no, what must change?

### What I Want Validated
User states 1-3 specific questions for analysis.

## Decision Framework

Evaluate and recommend one:

- **Go**: Math holds, key uncertainties low-risk, clear first milestone
- **No-Go**: Math fails, key assumption invalid, or blocker is insurmountable
- **Pivot**: Same problem but different approach, market, or pricing model

## Output

```markdown
## Feasibility: <idea>

### Constraints
[filled from brief]

### Math Check
[analysis of whether numbers work]

### Verdict: [Go / No-Go / Pivot]
[rationale in 2-3 sentences]

### Recommended Next Step
[one specific action]
```

## Next Steps
- Math unclear → use **interview** skill to pressure-test assumptions
- Ready to build → use **engineering-brief** for technical planning
- Need validation → design a cheap experiment for the riskiest assumption
